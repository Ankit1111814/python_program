# This code snippet is a simple demonstration of string concatenation and multiplication in Python.
# It takes a string "2", an integer 3, and a character "@", then
# concatenates the string with the character and multiplies the result by the integer.# The output will be "@@@" since "2" is treated as a string and concatenated
# with "@" three times.# to produce the final output.
# The output will be "@@@" since "2" is treated as a string and concatenated
# with "@" three times
